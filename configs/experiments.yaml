da_on_cl:
  description: "DA methods evaluated in CL setting"
  methods: [dann, cdan, mcd, toalign, pmtrans]
  datasets: [imagenet_r, cub200, inaturalist]
  setting: cl
  seeds: [0, 1, 2]
  expected_outcome: "very_poor"
  reason: "No mechanism to prevent forgetting"

da_on_dg:
  description: "DA methods evaluated in DG setting"
  methods: [dann, cdan, mcd, toalign, pmtrans]
  datasets: [domainnet, office_home]
  setting: dg
  seeds: [0, 1, 2]
  expected_outcome: "poor"
  reason: "No target data during training - adversarial loss overfits to source"

# DG methods → other settings  
dg_on_cl:
  description: "DG methods evaluated in CL setting"
  methods: [irm, vrex, coral, swad, miro, eoa]
  datasets: [imagenet_r, cub200, inaturalist]
  setting: cl
  seeds: [0, 1, 2]
  expected_outcome: "very_poor"
  reason: "No multi-domain signal in single task - invariance penalty is trivial"

dg_on_da:
  description: "DG methods evaluated in DA setting"
  methods: [irm, vrex, coral, swad, miro, eoa]
  datasets: [domainnet, office_home]
  setting: da
  seeds: [0, 1, 2]
  expected_outcome: "moderate"
  reason: "Can learn invariant features but misses opportunity to adapt to target"

# CL methods → other settings
cl_on_da:
  description: "CL methods evaluated in DA setting"
  methods: [icarl, der, lwf, coda_prompt, xder, memo]
  datasets: [domainnet, office_home]
  setting: da
  seeds: [0, 1, 2]
  expected_outcome: "moderate"
  reason: "Buffer provides cross-domain memory but lacks explicit alignment"

cl_on_dg:
  description: "CL methods evaluated in DG setting"
  methods: [icarl, der, lwf, coda_prompt, xder, memo]
  datasets: [domainnet, office_home]
  setting: dg
  seeds: [0, 1, 2]
  expected_outcome: "moderate"
  reason: "Buffer maintains diversity but no invariance objective"
